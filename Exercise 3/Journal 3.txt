1.	In this Exercise, you learned how to use if-elif-else statements to run different tasks based on conditions that you define. Now practice that skill by writing a script for a simple travel app using an if-elif-else statement for the following situation: 

●	The script should ask the user where they want to travel. 
●	The user’s input should be checked for 3 different travel destinations that you define. 
●	If the user’s input is one of those 3 destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Enjoy your stay in ______!”
●	If the user’s input is something other than the defined destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Oops, that destination is not currently available.”
	
Write your script here. (Hint: remember what you learned about indents!)


# Define the three travel destinations
destinations = ["Los Angeles", "Denver", "New York"]

# Ask the user for their travel destination
user_destination = input("Where would you like to travel? ")

# Check if the user's input is one of the destinations
if user_destination in destinations:
    print(f"Enjoy your stay in {user_destination}!")
else:
    print("Oops, that destination is not currently available.")


2.	Imagine you’re at a job interview for a Python developer role. The interviewer says “Explain logical operators in Python”. Draft how you would respond.
    a.	In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. There are three logical operators: and, or, and not. The and operator returns True if both the conditions it joins are true. The or operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is true. And the not operator flips the Boolean value of the condition that follows it.

3.	What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?
    a.	Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. You define a function once and can then call it from other parts of your code as many times as you need. They're useful because they allow you to encapsulate a task in one place so if you need to make a change, you only have to do it in one spot.

4.	In the section for Exercise 1 in this Learning Journal, you were asked in question 3 to set some goals for yourself while you complete this course.  In preparation for your next mentor call, make some notes on how you’ve progressed towards your goals so far.
    a.	My understanding of Python has certainly deepened. I've tackled small projects, like travel app script above as well as the work I have done so far on the recipe app. I'm not yet building web applications, but with the foundation I'm establishing now, I feel confident that I'm on the right path to achieving that.
