Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

●	Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
●	Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
a.	Frontend web development involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website, while backend development focuses on server-side operations and data handling. If I were hired for backend programming, I'd work on tasks like database management, server communication, authentication, and business logic.

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
a.	As a full-stack developer, I'd recommend Python for its versatility and readability. Python offers similar capabilities to JavaScript for web development but with more elegant and concise code, making it easier to maintain. It's also great for back-end tasks, promoting code reuse and a seamless development experience.

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
a.	During this Achievement, I aim to deepen my Python knowledge. I want to build practical projects, grasp advanced concepts, and continue to practice and master development best practices. After this Achievement, I envision myself working on web applications, potentially leveraging Python's power and versatility.
