●	Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
●	Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks 
●	Install and get started with Django

Reflection Questions

1.	Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
    a.	Vanilla Python offers simplicity and full control but lacks built-in features for web development; Django, a framework, provides a robust set of tools and a structured approach but can be more complex and less flexible.

2.	In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?
    a.	The key advantage of MVT over MVC is that it separates the user interface (template) from the business logic, leading to more modular and maintainable code.

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
    •	Gain a deep understanding of Django's capabilities for web development.
    •	Achieve practical skills and knowledge to confidently build and deploy web applications.
